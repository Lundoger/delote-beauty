My project, a website dedicated to cosmetic services, is crafted using modern technologies. It features a fully responsive design implemented with the BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) methodology, paving the way for ease of maintenance and scalability. The site's styles are developed using the SCSS preprocessor, integrating mixins for more efficient and manageable CSS. Additionally, the site's functionality is enriched with dynamic JavaScript, adding interactive elements for an enhanced user experience. The result is an engaging exploration of the world of self-care, supported by cutting-edge frontend development technologies.
